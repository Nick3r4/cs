     <hl>		</hl>We got a little robot named lightbot and we had to give it commands to get to the blue square and light it up. It got progresively harder by giving us functions that we could define ourselves to make lightbot do multiple things by just putting down one block.<hl>

     <hl>		</hl>We spent a while working on this project. To start we were going to make a fish but we settled last minute for making a solar system. We used i to space out the planets and spcaed out the planets and made them dissapear and re appear to appear as if they're roatating.<hl>

    <br>
    <hl>   	       </hl>We spent a lot of time working on this as well. We had used inputs to make the snake move using the keys wasd and we had also made death barriers such as if the snake runs into itself or the wall the game would stop. To finish it we added a score of the current player which went up by an addition of 10 points per apple and a highscore to keep your highest score.<hl>
